Project Planning Meeting - Q1 2026 Product Launch
Date: February 7, 2026
Attendees: Sarah Chen (Product Manager), Michael Rodriguez (Engineering Lead), Emily Watson (Design Lead), David Kim (Marketing Director)

Sarah Chen opened the meeting by outlining the primary objective: launching our new AI-powered analytics dashboard by March 31st, 2026. She emphasized that this is a critical deadline as we've already committed to several enterprise clients who are expecting the product in Q1.

Michael Rodriguez raised immediate concerns about the timeline. The engineering team is currently at 80% capacity due to ongoing maintenance of the legacy system. He mentioned that the new dashboard requires integration with three external APIs - Salesforce, HubSpot, and Google Analytics - and his team hasn't received the API documentation for HubSpot yet. Michael suggested that we might need to bring in two additional contractors to meet the deadline, but noted that the budget for contractors hasn't been approved yet.

Emily Watson presented the initial design mockups and mentioned that user testing is scheduled for next week. However, she pointed out that the design team is still waiting for final approval on the color scheme and branding guidelines from the executive team. The designs assume we'll be using the new brand colors, but if those change, it could set the design timeline back by at least a week.

David Kim discussed the go-to-market strategy. He's planning a launch event for March 28th and has already started reaching out to tech journalists. However, he noted that the marketing team needs the final product screenshots and demo videos by March 15th at the latest to prepare marketing materials. David also mentioned that he's assuming the product will have all the features listed in the original product spec, particularly the real-time collaboration feature, which he's already mentioned to several prospects.

Several action items were identified during the meeting:
- Michael needs to follow up with the HubSpot partnership team to get the API documentation
- Sarah will present the contractor budget request to the CFO by next Friday
- Emily's team will conduct user testing sessions next Tuesday and Wednesday
- The executive team needs to finalize branding guidelines
- Engineering will provide a detailed technical architecture document
- Marketing needs product screenshots by March 15th

There was significant discussion about the real-time collaboration feature. Michael expressed that this is technically complex and might not be feasible within the current timeline. Sarah mentioned that this feature was a key selling point for two of our enterprise clients, but acknowledged that we might need to launch without it and add it in a subsequent release. No final decision was made on this point.

The meeting concluded with agreement that everyone would reconvene next Monday to review progress. However, there's uncertainty about whether the executive team will have made their branding decisions by then. Additionally, nobody has confirmed who will be responsible for writing the user documentation, and there's no clear owner for the QA testing process.

Budget constraints were mentioned multiple times but no specific numbers were discussed. The team is operating under the assumption that the original $500K budget is still valid, but this hasn't been reconfirmed with finance recently.

One critical point that came up near the end: the infrastructure team hasn't been consulted about hosting requirements for the new dashboard. Michael mentioned that the current infrastructure might not support the expected load, especially if we're targeting enterprise clients with large datasets. This could be a significant blocker that hasn't been addressed yet.
