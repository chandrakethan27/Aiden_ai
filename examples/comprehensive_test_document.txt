EXECUTIVE STRATEGY MEETING - CLOUD MIGRATION PROJECT
Date: February 7, 2026
Attendees: Sarah Chen (CTO), Marcus Williams (VP Engineering), Jennifer Lopez (Project Manager), David Kim (Security Lead), Rachel Green (Finance Director)

MEETING SUMMARY:

The executive team convened to finalize the strategy for migrating our legacy on-premise infrastructure to AWS cloud services. The migration must be completed by June 30, 2026, to meet our commitment to the board and reduce operational costs by 40%. This is a critical initiative that will affect all 15 engineering teams and approximately 200 production applications.

KEY DECISIONS MADE:

1. APPROVED: Phased migration approach starting with non-critical systems in March 2026
   - Phase 1 (March-April): Development and staging environments
   - Phase 2 (May): Non-critical production services
   - Phase 3 (June): Mission-critical applications including payment processing

2. APPROVED: Budget allocation of $2.8 million for cloud migration
   - $1.5M for AWS infrastructure costs (first year)
   - $800K for consulting services from AWS Professional Services
   - $500K contingency fund for unexpected issues

3. DECIDED: Hybrid cloud strategy for compliance-sensitive data
   - Customer payment data will remain on-premise for PCI-DSS compliance
   - All other data will migrate to AWS
   - Need to implement VPN connectivity between on-premise and cloud

4. REJECTED: Proposal to migrate everything in one "big bang" weekend
   - Too risky given the number of interdependencies
   - Would require 48-hour maintenance window unacceptable to business

5. APPROVED: Hiring of 3 additional DevOps engineers specializing in AWS
   - Recruitment to begin immediately
   - Target start date: March 1, 2026
   - Budget approved by Finance

CRITICAL ACTION ITEMS:

1. Marcus Williams to create detailed migration runbooks for all 200 applications by February 20, 2026

IDENTIFIED RISKS AND CONCERNS:

HIGH SEVERITY RISKS:

1. Data Loss During Migration
   - No tested backup and restore procedures for cloud environment
   - Current backup solution (Veeam) may not be compatible with AWS
   - Mitigation: Need to pilot backup solution in Phase 1

2. Downtime Exceeding SLA Commitments
   - Customer SLA guarantees 99.9% uptime
   - Migration windows could violate SLAs
   - No customer communication plan in place yet
   - Mitigation strategy: TBD

3. Cost Overruns
   - AWS pricing model is complex and usage-based
   - Team has limited experience estimating cloud costs
   - Initial estimates may be 30-50% off actual costs
   - Finance concerned about budget accuracy

4. Security Vulnerabilities
   - Cloud security model different from on-premise
   - Team lacks AWS security expertise
   - Potential for misconfigured S3 buckets or security groups
   - Could lead to data breach

MEDIUM SEVERITY RISKS:

5. Vendor Lock-in
   - Heavy use of AWS-specific services limits future flexibility
   - No multi-cloud strategy defined
   - Concern raised by CTO but not fully addressed

6. Performance Degradation
   - Network latency between on-premise and cloud during hybrid phase
   - Some applications not optimized for cloud architecture
   - User experience could suffer

7. Compliance Issues
   - GDPR data residency requirements unclear for EU customers
   - HIPAA compliance for healthcare client data needs validation
   - Legal team has not reviewed cloud compliance yet

LOW SEVERITY RISKS:

8. Team Burnout
   - Aggressive timeline may require overtime
   - Coincides with Q2 product releases
   - No additional headcount approved beyond 3 DevOps engineers

OPEN QUESTIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES:

1. Database Migration Strategy
   - Should we use AWS Database Migration Service or manual migration?
   - What is the downtime window for database cutover?
   - Who has expertise in database migration? (No clear owner)

2. Network Architecture
   - What is the bandwidth requirement for VPN between on-premise and AWS?
   - Do we need AWS Direct Connect or is VPN sufficient?
   - Current network team has no cloud networking experience

3. Licensing Implications
   - Can we transfer our existing Oracle licenses to AWS?
   - What about Windows Server licenses?
   - Procurement team needs to investigate - no timeline given

4. Disaster Recovery Location
   - Should we use multi-region AWS deployment?
   - What is the cost difference between single and multi-region?
   - RTO/RPO requirements not formally documented

5. Third-Party Integrations
   - Will our monitoring tools (Datadog, PagerDuty) work in AWS?
   - What about our CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins)?
   - Need to audit all 50+ third-party integrations

6. Customer Impact
   - How do we communicate migration to customers?
   - What if customers object to cloud hosting?
   - Marketing and customer success teams not involved in planning yet

7. Rollback Procedures
   - If Phase 3 fails, can we rollback to on-premise?
   - How long would rollback take?
   - Do we maintain on-premise infrastructure as backup? (Cost implications)

ASSUMPTIONS BEING MADE:

1. AWS will provide adequate support through Professional Services engagement
2. Current team can learn AWS technologies quickly enough to meet timeline
3. No major application rewrites will be required for cloud compatibility
4. Network bandwidth is sufficient for data transfer during migration
5. Board will approve the plan without major changes
6. No regulatory changes will impact cloud hosting in next 6 months
7. Existing monitoring and security tools will work in AWS environment
8. Customer contracts allow for cloud hosting (legal review pending)

MISSING INFORMATION:

1. Complete inventory of all applications and their dependencies
2. Current infrastructure costs for accurate ROI calculation
3. Detailed network topology and bandwidth utilization
4. List of all compliance requirements and certifications needed
5. Skills assessment of current engineering team
6. Customer contract review for cloud hosting restrictions
7. Vendor contracts that may have cloud-specific terms

CONSTRAINTS AND LIMITATIONS:

1. Hard deadline of June 30, 2026 - cannot be extended due to board commitment
2. Budget cap of $2.8M - no additional funding available until next fiscal year
3. Cannot hire more than 3 additional engineers due to headcount freeze
4. Must maintain PCI-DSS compliance throughout migration
5. Zero tolerance for customer data loss
6. Maximum acceptable downtime: 4 hours per application
7. All changes must go through standard change management process (adds 1 week delay)
8. Security team must approve all AWS configurations before deployment
9. Finance requires monthly cost reports - no exceptions

NEXT STEPS:

The team will reconvene on February 14, 2026, for the first weekly status meeting. All action items must show measurable progress. Sarah Chen emphasized that this project is the company's top priority for 2026 and failure is not an option. However, several team members expressed concern about the aggressive timeline and lack of cloud expertise.

Marcus Williams noted that the success of this migration depends heavily on getting the AWS Professional Services contract signed quickly and completing the application inventory. Without these two items, the March 1 start date for Phase 1 is at risk.

Rachel Green requested that all teams provide their current infrastructure costs by February 10 to finalize the ROI analysis for the board presentation.

The meeting concluded with acknowledgment that significant unknowns remain, but the executive team is committed to the migration timeline.
